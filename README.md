# Professional README Generator Starter Code

[How to create a Professional README](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/github/professional-readme-guide)

## Description
As a developer, I want to create a README.md file generator using inquirer js. 

## Usage 
The generator was designed to ask the user questions about what to include into their README.md file. It was also designed to use the user's input and generate it into a new ReadME.md file. 

## Installation 
Currently the README.md generator is under maintenance. Working on getting the function to write the README file to run properly, and the license rendr functions also need attention.
